I have provided the a jar executable file. If that does not work, I also ran the java code in visual studio code. 

usage: 

Click on Image or Sound to start. 

Then Select file you want to use. For Image it only accepts png and for Sound it is only wav files. 

After it will run the code and the text output files will be created within the same directory.
